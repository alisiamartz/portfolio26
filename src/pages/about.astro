        I’m Alisia Martinez—an experience designer and prototyper who builds things people can <strong>feel</strong>.

        At the core of everything I do is the same impulse: to translate imagination into real life—turning a vibe,
        a story, or a messy early idea into something tangible enough to react to, test, and believe.
      </p>

      <p class="muted max-w-4xl">
        I’m drawn to work that creates connection and aliveness—experiences that help people feel more oriented,
        more seen, and more themselves. That can look like a product prototype that de-risks a decision,
        an immersive interaction that makes a moment land in your body, or a story-shaped experience that changes
        how you understand what just happened.

        <ul class="muted list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Turning ambiguity into artifacts.</strong> I make ideas real fast so teams can stop debating in theory.</li>
          <li><strong>Designing moment-to-moment experience.</strong> Pacing, feedback, clarity, delight—without losing the plot.</li>
          <li><strong>Systems thinking with taste.</strong> State, transitions, edge cases, interaction rules that feel coherent.</li>
          <li><strong>Worldbuilding.</strong> Atmosphere, tone, and the emotional logic of an experience—not just “features.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted">
          I build prototypes that are believable enough to trigger honest feedback, comparable enough to evaluate options
          fairly, and crafted enough to feel real—without over-investing too early.
        </p>
        <ul class="muted list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Believable:</strong> real enough to feel true</li>
          <li><strong>Comparable:</strong> options can be evaluated apples-to-apples</li>
          <li><strong>Crafted:</strong> high signal, low noise</li>

        I’m building a broader creative practice that includes storytelling (video), live experiences (events), and playful
        worldbuilding. My career is portfolio-shaped on purpose: a body of work that’s cohesive because it follows a point
        of view, not a single title.
