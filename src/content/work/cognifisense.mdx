## The moment
This project was a reminder that “good UX” is often just *care*: anticipating confusion, reducing cognitive load, and making the system feel trustworthy.

## What I built
- Iterative prototypes to refine interaction flows and feedback
- Information hierarchy and micro-interactions that support comprehension
- Clear states and error handling to reduce uncertainty

## Experience principles ✦
- **Confidence is a design outcome:** users should feel oriented and capable
- **Lower cognitive load:** reduce decisions, clarify next steps
- **Feedback earns trust:** always show what changed and why
