## Overview
This project was a reminder that “good UX” is often just *care*: anticipating confusion, reducing cognitive load, and making the system feel trustworthy.

## Challenge
The experience needed to stay understandable and supportive under real user needs, including moments of uncertainty, cognitive load, and error recovery.

## Approach
- Iterative prototypes to refine interaction flows and feedback
- Information hierarchy and micro-interactions that support comprehension
- Clear states and error handling to reduce uncertainty

## Process
I iterated on interaction loops, tested comprehension at each step, and tightened feedback so users always had a clear sense of what changed and what to do next.

### Experience principles ✦
- **Confidence is a design outcome:** users should feel oriented and capable
- **Lower cognitive load:** reduce decisions, clarify next steps
- **Feedback earns trust:** always show what changed and why

## Outcome
The final interaction model improved usability and user confidence through clearer state communication and more intentional feedback timing.
