## The moment
I wanted to build a VR narrative that feels *inevitable*—like you’re inside a scene, not watching one. “Lift” became a playground for pacing, tension, and embodied interaction.

## What I built
- A **story-led interaction model** with clear affordances and restrained mechanics
- A **pacing system** that balances exploration with narrative momentum
- Environmental storytelling and feedback loops that support “what should I do next?”

## Design goals
- **Make choices feel physical** (not menu-driven)
- **Keep the player oriented** with clear feedback and staging
- **Deliver emotion through interaction**, not exposition

## Experience principles ✦
- **Embodiment over UI:** minimize overlays; let the world communicate
- **Delight with restraint:** a few strong mechanics > many weak ones
- **Cinematic clarity:** staging, timing, and feedback are part of the story

## Impact
Lift is my proof that I can build experiences that are:
- technically real
- emotionally resonant
- designed with intention from moment-to-moment
