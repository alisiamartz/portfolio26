## Overview
R&D work lives in the gap between “cool idea” and “what could we actually ship?” My role was to close that gap with prototypes that make tradeoffs visible.

## Challenge
Immersive concepts had to be evaluated under tight constraints and evolving requirements, which meant translating abstract ideas into testable experiences fast.

## Approach
- Concept prototypes to explore immersive interaction patterns
- Rapid iterations for stakeholder critique and alignment
- System sketches (flows, states, feedback) to clarify how experiences behave

## Process
Each prototype cycle focused on making technical and UX tradeoffs visible early, then refining interaction behavior based on critique and feasibility checks.

### Experience principles ✦
- **Make constraints visible:** prototypes reveal what the idea costs
- **Clarity before cleverness:** delight only works if comprehension is intact
- **Iteration as strategy:** build small, learn fast, refine intentionally

## Outcome
These prototypes helped teams evaluate direction faster and align on concepts with a clearer understanding of feasibility, interaction quality, and product risk.
