## The moment
When a product is still forming, the hardest part is making decisions with confidence. My job was to turn “could be” into “here it is”—so teams could feel the experience, identify constraints, and decide faster.

## What I built
- **Interactive flow prototypes** to explore onboarding pacing, clarity, and feedback
- **System behavior studies** (states, transitions, responsiveness, error handling)
- **Mechanics explorations** to test different experience directions quickly
- **Crit-ready artifacts**: walkthroughs, annotated clips, and structured feedback prompts

## How I work
I optimize for two things:
1) **Believability** — the prototype is real enough to trigger honest reactions  
2) **Comparability** — different options can be evaluated apples-to-apples

## Experience principles ✦
- **Pacing & feedback:** every step answers “what happened?” and “what next?”
- **Clarity under uncertainty:** prototypes make assumptions visible and debatable
- **Delight grounded in usability:** charm should improve understanding, not distract from it

## Impact
- Turned debate into **testable artifacts** that accelerated decision-making  
- Created a shared “language” across design, research, and engineering  
- Surfaced edge cases and constraints early to **de-risk engineering investment**
