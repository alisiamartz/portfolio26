## The moment
Teams were weighing multiple directions. I made the options real enough to **feel**, test, and decide.

## What I built
- A set of high-fidelity interaction prototypes to explore home mechanics and onboarding pacing
- System behavior studies (feedback, state, transitions)
- Iterative walkthrough artifacts for cross-functional critique

## Experience principles (how I design)
- **Pacing & feedback:** every step should answer “what just happened?” and “what next?”
- **Clarity under uncertainty:** prototypes reduce debate by making assumptions visible
- **Delight grounded in usability:** charm is only useful if it improves understanding

## Impact
- Unblocked decisions by turning debate into testable flows  
- Created a shared “language” across design, research, and engineering  
- De-risked engineering investment by surfacing constraints early

## What I’d do next
If I had another iteration cycle, I’d run a structured prototype bake-off and quantify comprehension + time-to-success.
