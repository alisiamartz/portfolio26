## The moment
Multiplayer is where experiences become *alive*—and also where ambiguity explodes. Duet is an exploration of how to make shared actions feel coordinated, readable, and satisfying.

## What I built
- A multi-user interaction loop with **shared state**
- Feedback systems to make other players’ actions **legible**
- A simple “social choreography” where timing and role clarity matter

## What I learned
- Social UX is often about **predictability** and **feedback**, not complexity
- Shared systems need clear rules so people can trust them
- Tiny latency/edge cases can break the emotional illusion fast

## Experience principles ✦
- **Make other people readable:** show intent, state, and outcome
- **Design for coordination:** reduce ambiguity in who does what when
- **Respect the loop:** feedback should reward cooperation immediately
