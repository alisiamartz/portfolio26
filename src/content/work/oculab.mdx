## The moment
The best research environments feel magical—but they run on invisible structure. I helped create that structure while staying close to the building work.

## What I did
- Lab stewardship and operational organization (tools, processes, readiness)
- Support for prototyping workflows and experimentation
- Collaboration with researchers to keep iterations moving

## Experience principles ✦
- **Infrastructure enables creativity:** good systems create more room for play
- **Reduce friction:** remove small blockers that slow experimentation
- **Stay close to the work:** operations should serve craft, not replace it
