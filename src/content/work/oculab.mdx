## Overview
The best research environments feel magical—but they run on invisible structure. I helped create that structure while staying close to the building work.

## Challenge
Research environments move quickly, but throughput drops when operations are inconsistent. The challenge was creating structure without slowing experimentation.

## Approach
- Lab stewardship and operational organization (tools, processes, readiness)
- Support for prototyping workflows and experimentation
- Collaboration with researchers to keep iterations moving

## Process
I focused on removing recurring friction points, standardizing readiness practices, and partnering directly with researchers so infrastructure decisions stayed grounded in real prototype needs.

### Experience principles ✦
- **Infrastructure enables creativity:** good systems create more room for play
- **Reduce friction:** remove small blockers that slow experimentation
- **Stay close to the work:** operations should serve craft, not replace it

## Outcome
The lab became more reliable and easier to operate, which improved experiment throughput and helped teams sustain faster iteration cycles.
